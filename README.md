## Installation
1. Important: Before you start you have to rename 4 Files:  
   example.env -> **.env**  
   app/config/example.config.php -> **config.php**  
   app/templates/navigation/example.main-nav.tpl -> **main-nav.tpl**
   app/templates/example.faq.tpl -> **faq.tpl**     
   public/styles/css/example.custom.css -> **custom.css**  
3. Add your Database credentials and the OpenAI-API Key (https://platform.openai.com) to you .env File
4. Optionally, in the .env file you can setup an SMTP-E-Mail Server (used for Password recovery) or define IP-Ranges that do not require Logins e.g. for Intranet Usage
5. Import the Prompt Database (supplied externally) into your Database (e.g. with PHP My Admin)
6. run "composer install"

## Configuration
In the config.php File you can setup Categories which you can use to seperate your Prompts into groups e.G. Editorial, Support, Sales.  
Prompt-Categories can be accessed like this: www.buddy.com/categoryname  
You should setup your navigation (app/tamples/navigation/main-nav.tpl) according to your Prompt-Categories

## Customization
You can change CSS in you custom.css File (public/styles/css/custom.css)  
Uncomment the :root Variables and change the colors to your liking e.g. blue --primary: #4585c4;
